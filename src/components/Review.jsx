      'I had the pleasure of teaching Simrit at Cornell University for the course "Entrepreneurship for Scientists and Engineers" (NBA 5070). Simrit is a motivated, forward-thinking, and intelligent student. Simrit and her team took on a course with a massive workload and delivered an exceptional final business plan and investor-ready presentation, where she was the clear and prepared leader of the team. As a team member or a leader for a company, Simrit earns my highest recommendation. ',

      "Having worked with Simmy during her time at Baxter, I can say she was a real asset to our team. During her time with us she worked on applying multivariate data analysis (machine learning and data analytics) in our manufacturing processes, which resulted in significant savings. Simmy was also tasked with providing global training on our hardware and software implementation platform. She was always willing to take on new challenges within our group, and was a great partner to the teams she interfaced with. ",

Simmy brought creative ideas and exceptional design skills to the table, laying a solid foundation for our project by helping us decide what to build and which APIs to use. Her confident and self-assured demeanor had a positive impact on the entire team, inspiring everyone to contribute their best efforts. Simmy’s ability to combine creativity with clear direction made her an invaluable teammate during the hackathon. I truly enjoyed working with Simmy and highly recommend her for any project or role she pursues.",

She naturally took well to a leadership role several times, was fantastic at helping manage the timeline of the project, and was a genuine pleasure to work with. She learns quickly, and I found we worked very well as a team. She would be a great addition to any team, especially as a leader.",
